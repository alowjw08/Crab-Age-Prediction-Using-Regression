# Crab Age Prediction Using Regression

## Overview
This project aims to predict crab age using a variety of regression techniques. It involves comprehensive regression analyses to extract actionable insights from the dataset. The project was developed using Python, Google Colab, and scikit-learn.

## Project Description
- **Objective:**  
  Predict crab age by building and evaluating different regression models.

- **Approach:**  
  - Preprocess and clean the dataset.
  - Apply feature transformations to improve model generalization.
  - Implement and compare multiple regression algorithms.
  - Optimize models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Methods and Algorithms
The project employs several regression techniques, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**

### Key Techniques
- **Cross-Validation:**  
  Used to assess model performance and minimize overfitting.
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Optimizes parameters (e.g., tuning `alpha` for Lasso/Ridge and selecting the optimal `k` for KNN).

- **Feature Transformation:**  
  Enhances model performance by transforming input features.

## Results
- Each model was evaluated based on its predictive performance.
- The analysis provided insights into which regression technique best predicts crab age.
- Detailed performance metrics and visualizations were generated to compare the effectiveness of each model.
